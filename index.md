  <h1> <center> Prescribed Smiles </center> </h1>
  <p> <em> Welcome to prescribed smiles! The only 'prescription' that can truly lives up to the saying "laughter is the best medicine." </em> </p>
  <h2> Why? </h2>
  <p> The main reason we decided to create this one-button device was because elderly patients all over the world are laying on hospital beds right now. 
  Staying in two positions for a long period of time is obviously going to lead to some problems. Loneliness. Depression. Anxiety. 
  Mental illnesses are common to occur when one is alone. We want to prevent this and help work against it. </p>
    <h2> What? </h2>
    <p> We created a device similar to the look of a remote. The only job YOU have to do is place two double A batteries inside. 
      Once it's all fired up, we'll take care of the rest. Our workers have programmed over 500+ jokes inside of that tiny little rectangle for only $19.99! 
      It has an on/off button on the back of it and a single button on the front. That single button is your key to letting smiles be shown and laughter be head.
      Every time that button is pressed, a joke is let out! </p>
  <h2> Market Validation? </h2>
  <p> If this goes out into the market, I can assure you that audiences who will be more likely to buy it than others are senior citizens. The main reason is because
    the jokes revolve around the 80s as it is specifically targeted for the older audience. Everyone needs a laugh once in a while and so this device can give it! </p>
