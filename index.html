  <h1> <center> Prescribed Smiles </center> </h1>
  <p> <em> Welcome to prescribed smiles! The only 'prescription' that can truly lives up to the saying "laughter is the best medicine." </em> </p>
  <h2> Why? </h2>
  <p> The main reason we decided to create this monitor was because elderly patients all over the world are laying on hospital beds right now. 
  Staying in two positions for a long period of time is obviously going to lead to some problems. Loneliness. Depression. Anxiety. 
  Mental illnesses are common to occur when one is alone. We want to prevent this and help work against it. </p>
    <h2> What? </h2>
    <p> We created a monitor similar to the look of a baby monitor. The only job YOU have to do is place three double A batteries inside. 
      Once it's all fired up, we'll take care of the rest. Our workers have programmed over 500+ jokes inside of that tiny little monitor for only $19.99! 
      It has an on/off button on the back of it and a single button on the front. That single button is your key to letting smiles be shown and laughter be head.
      Every time that button is pressed, a joke is let out! </p>
