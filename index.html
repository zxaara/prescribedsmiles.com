<h1> Prescribed Smiles </h1>
  <p> Welcome to prescribed smiles! The only 'prescription' that can truly lives up to the saying "laughter is the best medicine." </p>
  <h2> Why? <h2>
  <p> The main reason we decided to create this monitor was because elderly patients all over the world could be lying on hospital beds right now. 
  Staying in two positions for a long period of time is obviously going to lead to some problems. Loneliness. Depression. Anxiety. 
  Mental illnesses are common to occur when one is alone. We want to prevent this and help work against it. </p>
    <h2> What? </h2>
    <p> We created a monitor similar to the look of a baby monitor. The only job YOU have to do is place three double A batteries inside. 
      Once it's all fired up, the simple touch of a button will let out a joke. The monitor has a single button on the bottom of it. 
      This button contains over 500+ jokes which are targeted more for the older generation. Every time you press the button, a joke is let out and smiles are shown.
    <h2> Motto </h2>
    <p> Laughter IS the best medicine. </p>
